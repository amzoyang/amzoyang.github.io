# bio
header: <font size="+2">Hi, I'm Amber Yang.</font>
desc: >
  The majority of my time is spent thinking about creating a sustainable space environment for satellites as the founder at <a href="seertracking.com"><b>Seer Tracking</b></a>, which led me to be named <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/amber-yang/#2fae76dd32de"><b>Forbes 30 Under 30</b></a>.<br><br> I'm a Computer Science and Physics student at <b>Stanford</b> and spent a quarter abroad studying Philosophy at Oxford. I've also dabbled a bit in VC and am a partner at <b>Dorm Room Fund</b>.<br><br> I'm always open to chatting about space, philosophy, politics. The best way to reach me is at <a href = "mailto: amber.yang@seertracking.com"><b>amber.yang@seertracking.com</b></a> or Twitter!
